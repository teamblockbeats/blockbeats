# blockBeats
## About
blockBeats is a dApp bound with an ERC-721 smart contract allowing for artists to distribute non-exclusive licenses to their music samples securely via IPFS and NFTs. 

Artists can create a listing for their samples on blockbeats, attaching a chosen price and an immutable link to the sample on IPFS which will be stored in the blockbeats smart contract. 

Buyers can view and preview these listings on blockbeats and have the option of buying a license for a listing. Upon buying a sample, the buyer will mint an NFT with the immutable IPFS file link and their wallet address attached. A buyer can then use their NFT ownership as cryptographic proof of their rights to use the sample.
